# Text Formatting GUI Application
## Explanation
__(Assignment 2 MCA)__ 

Script when run creates a window with a input text field, output text field and button in the middle. Type in the text you want to format and click on the **Format** button.

The Format button when clicked calls a function which takes the text of input field, formats and displays to the output field character by character.

Format function checks for text encapsuled  in '**' and makes it bold, similarly '__' for underline and '~~' for Italics. Also applies sentence case (capitalize first letter of a sentence) and capitalize letter 'i' if the character preceeding and suceeding it are blank space.

## Running Script
`python main.py`
